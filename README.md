# btool
A general-purpose *backup tool* aiming to facilitate basic aspects of creating, managing and deleting backups and dumps.

**IMPORTANT**: This project is still a WIP in the very early stages of development. It's definitely not usable yet, but any interest/contributions are greatly appreciated, just submit an issue or send me a message privately.
